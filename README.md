# Sales Insights Dashboard (Tableau)

# Problem Statement:
A Delhi-based computer hardware manufacturing company AltiQ, sales have declined recently, and the head sales director wants to identify where the business is failing. So you have been appointed by the sales head to build a dashboard that provides business insight to perform data driven-decision to maximize company profit.


# Solution:
After the initial EDA, I have connected Tableau to the MySQL Database.  

The general Database Schema for the Dashboard is shown in Figure 1:
